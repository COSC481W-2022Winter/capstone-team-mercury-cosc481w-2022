## Our Team
### Griffin Collingridge
I am Griffin, 25 year Computer Science student at EMU in my senior year and the team leader for this project. I am aspiring to be a Software Engineer for a career.
I would like to get a remote job, so I could move and live upstate. I work part time as a server at a brew pub in my hometown of Saline (the best city in Washtenaw County).
In my spare time I play the piano.
